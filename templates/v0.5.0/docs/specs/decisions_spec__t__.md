# Decision Log

A lightweight log of key architectural, process, and tooling decisions. Each entry includes context, decision, and consequences. New decisions should be appended to the top.

## Template
Copy/paste this snippet when adding a new decision:

```markdown

- Context: Brief background and alternatives considered.
- Decision: What we chose and why.
- Consequences: Immediate and long‑term effects, trade‑offs.
- Links: PR(s), discussion, related version(s) and Notes anchors.
