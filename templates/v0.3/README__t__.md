# Project README

Provide a concise summary of the project: what it does, who it’s for, and the primary value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git and a supported shell (e.g., Z shell on macOS). Other platforms/shells may be used depending on your stack.
- Recommended: use an environment manager to keep local setup consistent. For example, you can use Pyve to automate environment setup for Python projects. See https://github.com/pointmatic/pyve.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Initialize your development environment (language/tooling depends on the stack). Examples:
   - Python: configure a virtual environment, set a local runtime version, and install dependencies from your lockfile.
   - Node: install a supported Node version and run your package manager to install dependencies from the lockfile.
   - Shell/Other: follow language‑specific guidance in `docs/guides/lang/`.
3. If collaborating with an LLM, start with `docs/guides/llm_onramp_guide.md`.

## Installation
Document how to install or build artifacts if applicable (binaries, packages, containers). If not applicable, note that this is a source‑only repository.

## Usage
Provide the primary ways to run the software:
- CLI example: `tool --help`
- Module usage example
- Links to detailed usage in `docs/specs/technical_design_spec.md` or other docs

## Configuration
List configuration surfaces and where to set them:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- CLI flags

## Development
- Follow the contribution process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Dependency and version policy: `docs/guides/dependencies_guide.md` (language‑agnostic) and `docs/guides/lang/` for language‑specific details.
- Testing guidelines: `docs/guides/testing_guide.md`.
- Planning/design: `docs/guides/planning_guide.md`, `docs/specs/technical_design_spec.md`.
- LLM collaboration: see `docs/guides/llm_onramp_guide.md` for the reading order and operating rules.

## Troubleshooting
- Common setup pitfalls and how to resolve them.
- If using Pyve for Python projects, run `pyve --help` to see environment management options (init, purge, version, etc.).

## Security
- Do not commit secrets; use environment variables or your secret store.
- Least‑privilege for credentials and tokens.

## License
State the license and link to the `LICENSE` file if present.

## Acknowledgments
