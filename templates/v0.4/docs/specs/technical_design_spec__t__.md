# Technical Design

<!-- Phase 0: Project Basics -->
## Overview
Summarize the problem, the target users, and the outcomes this design aims to deliver. Keep this section concise and business‑oriented.

## Goals and Non‑Goals
- Goals: bullet list of measurable objectives.
- Non‑Goals: explicitly out‑of‑scope items to avoid scope creep.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Architecture
- High‑level diagram and narrative of the system boundaries, data/control flows, and trust boundaries.
- Deployment targets and runtime assumptions.

<!-- Phase 0: Project Basics -->
## Quality
- Quality Level: experiment | prototype | production | secure
- Guidance (apply based on chosen level):
  - Experiment: speed over rigor; minimal tests; throwaway acceptable.
  - Prototype: validate function/UX; basic error handling; smoke tests.
  - Production: reliability, observability, CI/CD, SLOs, on-call readiness.
  - Secure: threat modeling, hardening, least-privilege, audits/compliance.
- Entry/Exit criteria:
  - Define minimum gates (tests, lint, coverage, reviews, security scans) per level.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Components
Describe major components/services, their responsibilities, and interactions.
- Component A: purpose, inputs/outputs, key dependencies.
- Component B: purpose, inputs/outputs, key dependencies.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Data Model
- Core entities, schemas, and relationships.
- Storage engines and retention policies (if applicable).

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Interfaces
- External APIs, CLIs, or UIs, with key endpoints/commands and contracts.
- Internal module interfaces as needed.

<!-- Phase 2: Production Readiness -->
## Configuration
- Configuration surfaces (env vars, files, flags) and defaults.
- Secrets management approach (do not commit secrets).
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform/Pulumi/CloudFormation files location and state management.
- **Platform-specific config:** fly.toml, app.yaml, Dockerfile/Containerfile (Podman), docker-compose.yml/podman-compose.yml, k8s manifests, etc.
- **Environment parity:** ensuring dev/staging/prod consistency.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Algorithms / Processing
- Principal algorithms, workflows, or pipelines with step‑by‑step notes.
- Alternatives considered and rationale.

<!-- Phase 2: Production Readiness -->
## Error Handling & Resilience
- Failure modes, timeouts/retries/backoff, idempotency, and fallback strategies.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical (production/secure) | Phase 2: Production Readiness -->
## Performance & Scalability
- Expected load, latency/throughput targets, and scaling strategies.
- Caching/indexing/parallelism plans.

<!-- Phase 2: Production Readiness | Phase 3: Secure/Compliance -->
## Security & Privacy
- Threat model overview and mitigations.
- Permissions, least‑privilege, and data protection.

<!-- Phase 2: Production Readiness -->
## Observability
- Logging, metrics, tracing, and run reporting.

<!-- Phase 1: Core Technical -->
## Testing Strategy
- Unit, integration, and end‑to‑end coverage plans; test data.

<!-- Phase 2: Production Readiness -->
## Rollout & Migration
- Deployment plan, feature flags, migration/compatibility strategy, and rollback plan.
- **Deployment mechanism:** CI/CD pipeline, manual CLI, platform automation (git-push, webhooks).
- **Health checks:** readiness/liveness probes, smoke tests, canary validation.
- **Monitoring during rollout:** metrics to watch, alerting thresholds, rollback triggers.
- **Zero-downtime strategy:** blue-green, canary, rolling updates, database migrations.

## Open Questions
- Outstanding decisions or risks to resolve.
