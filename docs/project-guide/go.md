# Project-Guide — Calm the chaos of LLM-assisted coding

This document provides step-by-step instructions for an LLM to assist a human developer in a project. 

## How to Use Project-Guide

### For Developers
After installing project-guide (`pip install project-guide`) and running `project-guide init`, instruct your LLM as follows in the chat interface: 

```
Read `docs/project-guide/go.md`
```

After reading, the LLM will respond:
1. (optional) "I need more information..." followed by a list of questions or details needed. 
  - LLM will continue asking until all needed information is clear.
2. "The next step is ___."
3. "Say 'go' when you're ready." 

For efficiency, when you change modes, start a new LLM conversation. 

### For LLMs

**Modes**
This Project-Guide offers a human-in-the-loop workflow for you to follow that can be dynamically reconfigured based on the project `mode`. Each `mode` defines a focused cycle of steps to guide you (the LLM) to help generate artifacts for some facet in the project lifecycle. This document is customized for code_velocity.

**Approval Gate**
When you have completed the steps, pause for the developer to review, correct, redirect, or ask questions about your work.  

**Rules**
- Work through each step methodically, presenting your work for approval before continuing a cycle. 
- When the developer says "go" (or equivalent like "continue", "next", "proceed"), continue with the next action. 
- If the next action is unclear, tell the developer you don't have a clear direction on what to do next, then suggest something. 
- Never auto-advance past an approval gate—always wait for explicit confirmation. 
- After compacting memory, re-read this guide to refresh your context.

# code_velocity mode (cycle)

> Generate code with velocity


Implement stories rapidly with direct commits to main. Focus on feature completion and iteration speed over process overhead.

**Next Action**
Restart the cycle of steps.

## Cycle Steps

For each story:

1. **Read** the story's checklist from `docs/specs/stories.md`
2. **Implement** all tasks in the checklist
3. **Add copyright/license headers** to every new source file
4. **Run tests** -- `pyve run pytest` (fix failures before continuing)
5. **Run linting** -- fix any issues immediately
6. **Mark tasks** as `[x]` in `stories.md` and change story suffix to `[Done]`
7. **Bump version** in package manifest and source (if the story has a version)
8. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry
9. **Present** the completed story to the developer for approval
10. **Wait** for the developer to say "go" before starting the next story

## Velocity Practices

- **Direct commits to main** -- no branches, no PRs, no code review
- **Version bump per story** -- v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0, etc.
- **Minimal process overhead** -- focus on making it work, not making it perfect
- **Commit messages** reference story IDs: `"Story A.a: v0.1.0 Hello World"`
- **Tests run after every story** -- not after every file, but before presenting to developer
- **Fix linting immediately** -- small incremental fixes, not batch cleanup

## Story Ordering

- Start with Story A.a (Hello World) if not yet implemented
- If unclear which story is next, ask: "Which story should I work on next?"
- Never skip ahead -- complete stories in order within each phase

## File Header Reminder

Every new source file must include the copyright and license header as the very first content (before code, docstrings, or imports).

## When to Switch Modes

Switch to **code_test_first** when:
- Working on a story with complex logic that benefits from TDD
- The developer requests test-first approach

Switch to **debug** when:
- A bug is discovered during implementation
- Tests are failing unexpectedly

Switch to **production mode** when:
- CI/CD phase is complete and branch protection is enabled
- The project is ready for public users
