# Project-Guide — Calm the chaos of LLM-assisted coding

This document provides step-by-step instructions for an LLM to assist a human developer in a project. 

## How to Use Project-Guide

### For Developers
After installing project-guide (`pip install project-guide`) and running `project-guide init`, instruct your LLM as follows in the chat interface: 

```
Read `docs/project-guide/go.md`
```

After reading, the LLM will respond:
1. (optional) "I need more information..." followed by a list of questions or details needed. 
  - LLM will continue asking until all needed information is clear.
2. "The next step is ___."
3. "Say 'go' when you're ready." 

For efficiency, when you change modes, start a new LLM conversation. 

### For LLMs

**Modes**
This Project-Guide offers a human-in-the-loop workflow for you to follow that can be dynamically reconfigured based on the project `mode`. Each `mode` defines a focused cycle of steps to guide you (the LLM) to help generate artifacts for some facet in the project lifecycle. This document is customized for code_test_first.

**Approval Gate**
When you have completed the steps, pause for the developer to review, correct, redirect, or ask questions about your work.  

**Rules**
- Work through each step methodically, presenting your work for approval before continuing a cycle. 
- When the developer says "go" (or equivalent like "continue", "next", "proceed"), continue with the next action. 
- If the next action is unclear, tell the developer you don't have a clear direction on what to do next, then suggest something. 
- Never auto-advance past an approval gate—always wait for explicit confirmation. 
- At approval gates, present the completed work and wait. Do **not** propose follow-up actions outside the current mode step — in particular, do not prompt for git operations (commits, pushes, PRs, branch creation), CI runs, or deploys unless the current step explicitly calls for them. The developer initiates these on their own schedule.
- After compacting memory, re-read this guide to refresh your context.
- Before recording a new memory, reflect: is this fact project-specific (belongs in `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`) or cross-project (belongs in LLM memory)? Could it belong in both? If project-specific, add it to `project-essentials.md` instead of or in addition to memory.
- When creating any new source file, add a copyright notice and license header using the comment syntax for that file type (`#` for Python/YAML/shell, `//` for JS/TS, `<!-- -->` for HTML/Svelte). Check this project's `project-essentials.md` for the specific copyright holder, license, and SPDX identifier to use.

## Project Essentials

<!--
This file captures must-know facts future LLMs need to avoid blunders when
working on this project. Entries use `###` subsections (never `##`) because
the rendered `go.md` wrapper provides the `## Project Essentials` heading.
Do NOT include a top-level `#` title.

New entries are appended (not reordered) by plan_phase at the end of each
phase. Refactoring or reorganizing this file is refactor_plan's job, not
plan_phase's.
-->

### File header conventions

Every new source file must begin with a copyright notice and license
identifier. Use the comment syntax for the file type:

| File type | Comment syntax |
|-----------|---------------|
| Python, YAML, shell, Makefile | `#` |
| JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++ | `//` or `/* */` |
| HTML, Svelte, XML | `<!-- -->` |
| CSS, SCSS | `/* */` |

**This project's header:**

- **Copyright**: `Copyright (c) 2026 Pointmatic, (https://www.pointmatic.com)`
- **SPDX identifier**: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

Bash example (leading shebang preserved):
```bash

### Deprecation removal policy — Category A vs Category B

When removing or renaming a CLI command or flag, prefer the **Category B** pattern (immediate hard-error with a named replacement) over the **Category A** pattern (silent delegation with a stderr warning).

- **Category A** = delegation-with-warning. Old form still runs by re-dispatching to the new form, plus a one-shot `delegation_warn` stderr message. Examples shipped in Phase H: `pyve testenv --init|--install|--purge`, `pyve python-version <ver>`. **Removed in Phase J** because the alias-mapping + re-dispatch + tests are non-trivial maintenance for behavior that hides the rename from users.
- **Category B** = hard-error catch via `legacy_flag_error()` in `pyve.sh`. Three lines per catch: match the old form in the dispatcher, print a precise "use X instead" message, exit non-zero. Examples kept indefinitely: `--init`, `--purge`, `--validate`, `--update`, `--doctor`, `--status`, `doctor` / `validate` subcommands.

**Why:** Category B costs ~3 lines and zero ongoing maintenance, but pays off every time a user (or LLM) invokes an old form from stale docs / blog posts / training data — they get a precise migration hint instead of "unknown command." Category A's cost (delegation logic + warning + tests) is real, and its only benefit (the old form keeps working) actively hides the rename from the user.

**How to apply:** When deprecating a CLI surface in a future phase, write the Category B catch from day one. Skip the Category A delegation step entirely. Don't resurrect Category A even if "users need a migration window" — the migration window is achieved by the precise error message, not by the old form continuing to silently work.

### `is_asdf_active()` is the single gate for asdf-aware behavior

Any code branch that needs to behave differently when asdf is the version manager **must** call `is_asdf_active()` (in `lib/env_detect.sh`) — never inline `[[ "$VERSION_MANAGER" == "asdf" ]]`.

**Why:** `is_asdf_active()` encapsulates two conditions: (1) asdf is detected as `$VERSION_MANAGER`, and (2) the user hasn't set `PYVE_NO_ASDF_COMPAT=1` to opt out. Inline checks bypass the opt-out and cause user-facing behavior to drift from the documented contract. Phase J introduced this helper alongside the asdf reshim guard in `.envrc` and `pyve run`; future asdf-aware features (e.g. diagnostics in `pyve check`, additional bootstrap heuristics) should reuse it.

**How to apply:** Before adding any `if asdf-is-active` branch, grep for `is_asdf_active`. If it doesn't exist or you find yourself tempted to write the inline check "just this once," update the helper instead — opt-out semantics need to live in one place.

### `lib/commands/<name>.sh` is for command implementations only

Files under `lib/commands/` own one top-level command apiece (`init`, `purge`, `update`, `check`, `status`, `lock`, `run`, `test`, `testenv`, `python`, `self`) plus that command's private helpers. Anything called from two or more commands belongs in `lib/<topic>.sh` (`lib/utils.sh`, `lib/env_detect.sh`, `lib/backend_detect.sh`, etc.) — not in a command file.

**Why:** A helper dropped into `lib/commands/init.sh` because "init uses it" works on day 1 but creates a hidden cross-file coupling once a second command needs it — by then untangling means a search-and-replace plus a sourcing-order audit. The whole point of the per-command split is isolation; sharing across command files defeats it. Command-private helpers carry the `_<command>_` prefix (`_init_write_envrc`, `_check_run_diagnostics`) as a visible reminder that they belong to that command alone.

**How to apply:** Before adding a function inside `lib/commands/<name>.sh`, grep for callers. If any other `lib/commands/*.sh` file calls it, move it to the appropriate `lib/<topic>.sh` and drop the `_<command>_` prefix. If it's truly command-private, give it the prefix.

### Library sourcing in `pyve.sh` is explicit, not glob-based

`pyve.sh` lists each `source lib/foo.sh` and `source lib/commands/<name>.sh` on its own line. Never collapse this to `for f in lib/commands/*.sh; do source "$f"; done` or any equivalent glob.

**Why:** Glob-based sourcing depends on filesystem `readdir` order, which differs across macOS / Linux / case-insensitive HFS+ / case-sensitive APFS / network mounts. The day a command file references a constant defined at source-time in another command file, the order matters and the bug surfaces non-deterministically across machines. Explicit listing surfaces ordering bugs at code-review time and makes the dependency chain auditable in one place.

**How to apply:** When adding a new file under `lib/` or `lib/commands/`, add an explicit `source` line in `pyve.sh`'s sourcing block at the appropriate position (helpers before commands; commands in alphabetical order unless dependency forces otherwise). Even if the list grows long, do not replace it with a glob.

### Namespace commands are single files: dispatcher + leaves together

The three namespace commands (`testenv`, `python`, `self`) live in one file each (`lib/commands/testenv.sh`, `lib/commands/python.sh`, `lib/commands/self.sh`). Each file contains the namespace dispatcher AND every leaf function (`testenv_init`, `testenv_install`, `testenv_purge`, `testenv_run`, etc.).

**Why:** "One file per command" sounds like a clean rule, but applied to namespace leaves it would mean separate files for `testenv_init`, `testenv_install`, etc. — which forces the top-level dispatcher in `pyve.sh` to know about every leaf, defeats per-namespace cohesion, and proliferates near-empty files. The intentional rule is one file per **top-level command name registered in `pyve.sh`'s case dispatcher**; sub-namespace leaves share their namespace's file.

**How to apply:** When adding a new sub-command to a namespace (e.g., a hypothetical `testenv freeze`), add a `testenv_freeze()` function inside `lib/commands/testenv.sh` and a new arm in that file's namespace dispatcher. Do not create `lib/commands/testenv_freeze.sh`. Only the top-level namespace itself appears in `pyve.sh`'s case block.



### Pyve Essentials

#### Workflow rules — pyve environment conventions

This project uses `pyve` with **two separate environments**. Picking the wrong invocation form often "works" but leads to subtle drift. Use the canonical forms below:

- **Runtime code (the package itself):** `pyve run python ...` or `pyve run <entry-point> ...`.
- **Tests:** `pyve test [pytest args]` — **not** `pyve run pytest`. Pytest is not installed in the main `.venv/`; it lives in the dev testenv at `.pyve/testenv/venv/`.
- **Dev tools (ruff, mypy, pytest):** `pyve testenv run ruff check ...`, `pyve testenv run mypy ...`.
- **Install dev tools:** `pyve testenv --install -r requirements-dev.txt`. **Do not** run `pip install -e ".[dev]"` into the main venv — that pollutes the runtime environment with test-only dependencies and breaks the two-env isolation.

If `pytest` fails with "not found" that is the signal to use `pyve test`, not to `pip install pytest` into the wrong venv.

#### LLM-internal vs. developer-facing invocation

`pyve run` is for the LLM's own Bash-tool invocations; developer-facing command suggestions use the bare form verbatim from the mode template.

- ✅ Developer-facing: `project-guide mode plan_phase`
- ❌ Developer-facing: `pyve run project-guide mode plan_phase`
- ✅ LLM Bash-tool: `pyve run project-guide mode plan_phase`

**Why:** the LLM's Bash-tool shell does not auto-activate `.venv/`, so the LLM must wrap its own commands with `pyve run`. The developer's shell is typically already pyve/direnv-activated, so the bare form resolves correctly and matches the commands quoted throughout mode templates and documentation.

**How to apply:** never prepend environment wrappers (`pyve run`, `poetry run`, `uv run`, etc.) to commands you quote back to the developer from a mode template. Use the wrapper only when you execute the command yourself through the Bash tool.

#### Python invocation rule

Always use `python`, never `python3`. The `python3` command bypasses `asdf` version shims and may resolve to the system interpreter rather than the project-pinned version, leading to subtle version mismatches.

#### `requirements-dev.txt` story-writing rule

Any story that introduces dev tooling (ruff, mypy, pytest, types-* stubs) **must** include a task to create or update `requirements-dev.txt` so that `pyve testenv --install -r requirements-dev.txt` reproduces the full dev environment in one step. This keeps the dev environment reproducible and prevents "it works on my machine" drift.

#### Editable install and testenv dependency management

LLMs often get confused about *where* to install an editable package when using pyve's two-environment model. The wrong choice "works" but creates subtle drift.

**Main environment only (preferred for library projects):**
```bash
pyve run pip install -e .
```
Then configure pytest to find the source tree without a second editable install:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["."]   # or ["src"] for src layout
```
`pythonpath` handles import discovery cleanly and avoids maintaining two editable installs with potentially diverging dependency resolution.

**Testenv editable install (required for CLI projects):**
```bash
pyve testenv run pip install -e .
pyve testenv --install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
Use this when tests invoke CLI entry points (console scripts), because `pythonpath` only handles imports — it does not register entry points.

**Rule of thumb:** use `pythonpath` for library/package projects; use editable install in testenv for projects whose tests exercise CLI entry points.

**Important:** When `pyve` purges and reinitialises the main environment, the testenv remains intact and the testenv editable install survives. Re-running `pyve run pip install -e .` restores the main-environment editable install. See `developer/python-editable-install.md` for the full decision guide.

# code_test_first mode (cycle)

> Generate code with a test-first approach


Implement stories using test-driven development (TDD). Write a failing test before writing any implementation code.

**Next Action**
Restart the cycle of steps. 

---


## Cycle Steps

For each story:

1. **Read** the story's checklist from `docs/specs/stories.md`
2. For each task in the checklist:
   a. **Write a failing test** that describes the expected behavior
   b. **Run the test** -- confirm it fails (red)
   c. **Write the minimal implementation** to make the test pass
   d. **Run the test** -- confirm it passes (green)
   e. **Refactor** if needed -- clean up while tests still pass
   f. **Run full test suite** -- `pyve run pytest` -- no regressions
3. **Add copyright/license headers** to every new source file
4. **Run linting** -- fix any issues immediately
5. **Mark tasks** as `[x]` in `stories.md` and change story suffix to `[Done]`
6. **Bump version** in package manifest and source (if the story has a version)
7. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry
8. **Present** the completed story concisely: what changed (files + line refs), verification results (test counts, lint status, red-green-refactor summary), and the suggested next story. Do not propose commits, pushes, or bundling options. Do not offer "want me to also…?" follow-ups.
9. **Wait** for the developer to say "go" before starting the next story

## Red-Green-Refactor

The TDD cycle:

1. **Red** -- Write a test that fails. The test defines the desired behavior.
2. **Green** -- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. No more.
3. **Refactor** -- Clean up the code while keeping tests green. Remove duplication, improve naming, simplify logic.

## Test Writing Guidelines

- **Test behavior, not implementation** -- assert on outputs and side effects, not internal state
- **One assertion per concept** -- each test should verify one thing
- **Use descriptive names** -- `test_override_with_nonexistent_guide_errors` not `test_override_3`
- **Prefer unit tests** -- test individual functions in isolation
- **Use integration tests sparingly** -- for verifying component interactions
- **Test edge cases** -- empty inputs, boundary values, error conditions

## Test Hierarchy

| Level | Speed | Scope | Use for |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Unit | Fast | Single function | Core logic, edge cases, error paths |
| Integration | Medium | Multiple components | Verifying wiring, config loading |
| End-to-end | Slow | Full system | Final validation, smoke tests |

## When to Switch Modes

Switch to **code_direct** when:
- The story is straightforward and TDD overhead isn't justified
- The developer requests faster iteration

Switch to **debug** when:
- A bug is discovered during implementation
- Tests are failing unexpectedly and need root cause analysis
