This file captures must-know facts future LLMs need to avoid blunders when
working on this project. Entries use `###` subsections (never `##`) because
the rendered `go.md` wrapper provides the `## Project Essentials` heading.
Do NOT include a top-level `#` title.

New entries are appended (not reordered) by plan_phase at the end of each

### Deprecation removal policy — Category A vs Category B

When removing or renaming a CLI command or flag, prefer the **Category B** pattern (immediate hard-error with a named replacement) over the **Category A** pattern (silent delegation with a stderr warning).

- **Category A** = delegation-with-warning. Old form still runs by re-dispatching to the new form, plus a one-shot `delegation_warn` stderr message. Examples shipped in Phase H: `pyve testenv --init|--install|--purge`, `pyve python-version <ver>`. **Removed in Phase J** because the alias-mapping + re-dispatch + tests are non-trivial maintenance for behavior that hides the rename from users.
- **Category B** = hard-error catch via `legacy_flag_error()` in `pyve.sh`. Three lines per catch: match the old form in the dispatcher, print a precise "use X instead" message, exit non-zero. Examples kept indefinitely: `--init`, `--purge`, `--validate`, `--update`, `--doctor`, `--status`, `doctor` / `validate` subcommands.

**Why:** Category B costs ~3 lines and zero ongoing maintenance, but pays off every time a user (or LLM) invokes an old form from stale docs / blog posts / training data — they get a precise migration hint instead of "unknown command." Category A's cost (delegation logic + warning + tests) is real, and its only benefit (the old form keeps working) actively hides the rename from the user.

**How to apply:** When deprecating a CLI surface in a future phase, write the Category B catch from day one. Skip the Category A delegation step entirely. Don't resurrect Category A even if "users need a migration window" — the migration window is achieved by the precise error message, not by the old form continuing to silently work.

### `is_asdf_active()` is the single gate for asdf-aware behavior

Any code branch that needs to behave differently when asdf is the version manager **must** call `is_asdf_active()` (in `lib/env_detect.sh`) — never inline `[[ "$VERSION_MANAGER" == "asdf" ]]`.

**Why:** `is_asdf_active()` encapsulates two conditions: (1) asdf is detected as `$VERSION_MANAGER`, and (2) the user hasn't set `PYVE_NO_ASDF_COMPAT=1` to opt out. Inline checks bypass the opt-out and cause user-facing behavior to drift from the documented contract. Phase J introduced this helper alongside the asdf reshim guard in `.envrc` and `pyve run`; future asdf-aware features (e.g. diagnostics in `pyve check`, additional bootstrap heuristics) should reuse it.

**How to apply:** Before adding any `if asdf-is-active` branch, grep for `is_asdf_active`. If it doesn't exist or you find yourself tempted to write the inline check "just this once," update the helper instead — opt-out semantics need to live in one place.
