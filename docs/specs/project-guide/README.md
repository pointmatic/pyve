A Python CLI tool that installs, renders, and synchronizes battle-tested LLM workflow prompts across projects using mode-driven Jinja2 templates, with content-hash sync and project-specific overrides to keep documentation consistent while preserving customizations.

## Why project-guide?

The `go.md` prompt provides the LLM with a structured workflow:
- Adapts for your current development mode (plan, code, debug, document, refactor)
- Lets you stay in charge: guiding features, flow, and taste
- Handles the typing so you can stay focused on the big picture

### How It Works
- Install project-guide in any repository
- Initialize the Project-Guide system
- (optional) Set the project mode (plan, code, debug, etc.)
- Tell your LLM to read `docs/project-guide/go.md` (in your IDE, or however you prefer)

### Human-in-the-Loop Development

This is "HITLoop" (human-in-the-loop) development: you direct, the LLM executes--it is not vibe-coding. Instead you are following the development closely and interactively guiding and improving the flow. The pace is "flaming agile"--an entire production-ready backend can be completed in 6-12 hours.

### Customization and Updates

When you customize a file for your project, mark it as overridden so future package updates skip it. When you want the latest workflow improvements, run `project-guide update` to sync all non-overridden files.

## Key Features
- **Battle-Tested Workflows** - Crafted workflow prompts from concept through production release in one place
- **Mode-Driven Templates** - 15 modes rendered via Jinja2 so `go.md` always matches your current task
- **Content-Hash Sync** - SHA-256 hash comparison detects changes without relying on version numbers
- **Custom File Lock** - Lock customized files to prevent update overwrites
- **Gentle Force Updates** - Automatic `.bak` files created if you `--force` update a custom file
- **CLI Interface** - Intuitive commands for every step of the workflow (init, mode, status, update, heal, override, purge, …)
- **Auto-Heal** - Every command silently repairs the install if drift is detected; prompts only when there's actual work to do, so a fresh clone is one `project-guide <anything>` away from being usable
- **Shell Completion** - Tab completion for commands, flags, and mode names (bash, zsh, fish)
- **Well Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage across CLI, rendering, and action modules
- **Zero Configuration** - Works with sensible defaults out of the box
- **Cross-Platform** - Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Python 3.11+

## Installation

### Via pip

```bash
pip install project-guide
```

### Via pipx (recommended for CLI coding tools)

```bash
pipx install project-guide
```

### Dependencies

click, jinja2, pyyaml, packaging

### Shell Completion (Optional)

Enable Tab completion for commands, flags, and mode names. Add to your shell startup file:

```bash
# bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=bash_source project-guide)"

# zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=zsh_source project-guide)"
```

See [Installation Options](https://pointmatic.github.io/project-guide/user-guide/install-options/#shell-completion-optional) for fish and full details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize in your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
project-guide init
```

This creates:
- `.project-guide.yml` - Configuration file (tracked)
- `docs/project-guide/go.md` - Rendered LLM instructions (**unignored but intentionally untracked** as of v2.8.0 — must be visible to IDE-integrated LLMs, but kept out of git so branch switches don't trip on it)
- `docs/project-guide/` - Mode templates, artifact templates, and metadata (gitignored bundled data)

Everything under `docs/project-guide/` is gitignored **except** `go.md` (which the LLM reads). The gitignored template tree is bundled static data — `project-guide heal` repopulates it on first invocation in a fresh clone, and the auto-hook makes that healing run silently before any other command.

**Upgrading from v2.6.x – v2.7.x?** Earlier project-guide versions left `go.md` tracked by historical accident. v2.8.0 flips the policy to untracked-by-default to eliminate branch-switch and merge friction. If `heal` warns that `go.md` is tracked, run once on your default branch:

```bash
git rm --cached docs/project-guide/go.md && git commit -m "untrack go.md per project-guide v2.8.0"
```

The file stays visible to your IDE LLM (the gitignore block hasn't changed), but it stops appearing in diffs and stops blocking `git switch`.

### 2. Tell your LLM to read the guide

```
Read docs/project-guide/go.md
```

The LLM follows the instructions, asks clarifying questions, and generates artifacts. Type `go` to advance through steps.

### 3. Switch modes as you progress

```bash
project-guide mode plan_concept      # Define problem & solution
project-guide mode plan_features     # Define requirements
project-guide mode plan_tech_spec    # Define architecture
project-guide mode plan_stories      # Break into stories
project-guide mode plan_phase        # Add a new phase to stories
project-guide mode scaffold_project  # Scaffold license, manifest, README, CHANGELOG
project-guide mode code_direct       # Implement stories fast
project-guide mode code_test_first   # TDD red-green-refactor
project-guide mode debug             # Debug with test-first approach
project-guide mode archive_stories   # Archive completed stories.md before next phase
project-guide mode document_brand    # Brand descriptions
project-guide mode document_landing  # GitHub Pages + MkDocs docs
project-guide mode refactor_plan     # Plan a refactor
project-guide mode refactor_document # Document a refactor
```

Each mode re-renders `docs/project-guide/go.md` with focused instructions for that workflow.

### 4. List available modes

```bash
project-guide mode
```

Modes are displayed in category groups with availability markers:
- `→` — current mode (cyan background highlight)
- `✓` — all prerequisites met (green)
- `✗` — unmet prerequisites (yellow, dimmed)

On a real terminal, a numbered selection menu is shown so you can switch by entering a number. Under `--no-input`, `CI=1`, or piped input, only the listing is shown.

```
Current mode: code_direct

  Planning
  ✓  2  plan_concept               Generate a high-level concept
  ✓  3  plan_features              Generate feature requirements
  ...

  Coding
  →  6  code_direct                Generate code directly, test after
  ✓  7  code_test_first            Generate code with a test-first approach
  ...

Select mode [1-15, Enter to cancel]:
```

### 5. Update files

```bash
pip install --upgrade project-guide
project-guide update
```

Overridden files are skipped. Modified files prompt for confirmation. Backups are always created before overwrites.

### 6. Customize a file (optional)

```bash
project-guide override templates/modes/debug-mode.md "Custom debugging for this project"
```

## Command Reference

### `init`

Initialize project-guide in the current directory. Safe to run unattended — re-running on an already-initialized project is a silent exit-0 no-op, and the `--no-input` flag (plus auto-detection) ensures CI runners and post-hooks never hang on stdin.

```bash
project-guide init [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--target-dir PATH` - Directory for templates (default: `docs/project-guide`)
- `--force` - Overwrite existing configuration
- `--no-input` - Do not read from stdin; use defaults where sensible. Fail loudly if any prompt has no default. (Also auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY stdin.)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Initialize with default settings
project-guide init

# Use custom directory
project-guide init --target-dir documentation/workflows

# Force reinitialize
project-guide init --force
```

#### Unattended / CI use

`project-guide init` is safe to invoke from any unattended context (CI runners, `pyve` post-hooks, subprocess pipelines, shell scripts). Four independent triggers all enable skip-input mode, in priority order — the first match wins:

```bash
# 1. Explicit flag
project-guide init --no-input

# 2. PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT env var (truthy: 1, true, yes, on — case-insensitive)
PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1 project-guide init

# 3. CI env var (auto-detected on most CI runners)
CI=1 project-guide init

# 4. Non-TTY stdin (piped input, subprocess, closed stdin)
echo "" | project-guide init
```

**Idempotent re-run:** Running `project-guide init` a second time on a project that is already initialized is a silent exit-0 no-op (with an informational message). Use `--force` to re-run the full install and overwrite existing files. This makes the command safe to call unconditionally from automated flows.

### `mode`

Set or show the active development mode.

```bash
project-guide mode [MODE_NAME]
```

**Without argument:** Lists all modes grouped by category with ✓/✗/→ markers. Shows an interactive selection menu on TTY.

**With argument:** Switches to the specified mode and re-renders `go.md`.

**Options:**
- `--verbose` / `-v` — Show unmet prerequisite file paths beneath each `✗` entry
- `--no-input` — Show listing only; skip interactive menu

**Examples:**
```bash
# Show grouped listing (+ interactive menu on TTY)
project-guide mode

# Show listing with prerequisite details
project-guide mode --verbose

# Switch to direct coding mode
project-guide mode code_direct

# Switch to debugging mode
project-guide mode debug
```

### `archive-stories`

Archive `docs/specs/stories.md` and re-render a fresh one for the next phase. Wraps the deterministic `archive` action declared on the `archive_stories` mode.

```bash
project-guide archive-stories
```

This command:

1. Reads the latest version from the highest `### Story X.y: vN.N.N` heading in `stories.md`.
2. Detects the highest `## Phase <Letter>:` heading (informational only).
3. Extracts the `## Future` section verbatim if present.
4. Moves `stories.md` to `<spec_artifacts_path>/.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md`.
5. Re-renders a fresh empty `stories.md` from the bundled artifact template, carrying the `## Future` section over.

If any pre-check fails (no versioned stories, archive target already exists, source file missing) the command errors and leaves the workspace untouched. If the re-render fails after the move, the source is rolled back from `.archive/`.

This command is intended to be run by the LLM after the developer has approved the archive in `project-guide mode archive_stories`.

### `status`

Show status of all installed files and current mode. Output is compact and grouped into Mode, Guide, and Files sections with color.

```bash
project-guide status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--verbose` / `-v` - Show detailed file-level information

**Output includes:**
- Current package version and installed version
- Active mode with prerequisites status
- Status of the rendered guide
- File counts (current, need updating, missing, overridden)
- Stories section: total/done/in-progress/planned counts + next story (when `stories.md` exists)
- Per-file detail and per-phase story breakdown (verbose mode)

### `update`

Update files to the latest version. Uses SHA-256 content hash comparison to detect changes.

```bash
project-guide update [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--files NAME` - Update specific files only (repeatable)
- `--force` - Update even overridden files (creates backups)
- `--dry-run` - Show what would change without applying
- `--no-input` - Non-interactive mode (reserved for future prompts)
- `--quiet` / `-q` - Suppress per-file progress output

**Examples:**
```bash
# Update all files (skips overridden)
project-guide update

# Update specific files
project-guide update --files templates/modes/debug-mode.md

# Force update all (creates backups for overridden)
project-guide update --force

# Preview changes
project-guide update --dry-run
```

### `heal`

Repair the install: create missing template files and refresh stale ones to match the bundled package. Silent when there's nothing to do; prompts to apply when drift is detected.

```bash
project-guide heal [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--no-input` - Auto-yes the `[Y/n]` prompt and emit a one-line stderr notice when writes occur (also auto-enabled by `CI=1`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1`, or non-TTY stdin)

**When to use it:**
- After cloning a repo that has `project-guide init`'d output but the template tree is gitignored — heal repopulates it.
- After accidentally editing or deleting a bundled template file and wanting to restore the canonical version.
- Whenever you're not sure whether the install is up-to-date with the package version.

**Auto-hook:** every `project-guide` invocation (including `--help` and `--version`) calls heal first via a group-level hook, so the fresh-clone case usually resolves itself silently the first time you run *any* command. The hook is silent in the steady state and prompts only when there's actual drift.

**Tracked-`go.md` warning (v2.8.0+):** if `docs/project-guide/go.md` is in your git index, `heal` emits a stderr warning with a copyable migration command. The current policy is untracked-by-default — `go.md` stays visible to IDE LLMs (because it's unignored) but is kept out of the index so branch switches don't trip on it. The warning is non-fatal; the consumer applies the migration on their own schedule.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive: prompts on drift
project-guide heal

# Unattended (CI, scripts, embedding callers)
project-guide heal --no-input
```

### `git-push`

Wrap [gitbetter](https://github.com/pointmatic/gitbetter)'s `git-push` with a commit message auto-derived from the most-recently-completed-and-not-yet-committed story in `docs/specs/stories.md`. Optional: requires gitbetter on PATH.

```bash
project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]
```

**Arguments:**
- `BRANCH_NAME` (optional) - Passed through to gitbetter for branch-aware push flows (e.g. switching to a feature branch and offering cleanup after merge)

**Heading-to-message transformation:**
```
### Story G.a: v1.2.3 New command `foo` with "Hello" [Done]
                                ↓
       G.a: v1.2.3 New command 'foo' with 'Hello'
```
Backticks and double quotes become single quotes; single quotes pass through; the colon after the story ID is preserved (it's the anchor for the already-committed check).

**Hard errors (exit 1):**
- No `[Done]` story in `stories.md`
- The last `[Done]` story is already committed — the wrapper does not second-guess; resolve manually with raw `git-push`
- Multiple `[Done]` stories are uncommitted — commit them one at a time with explicit messages via raw `git-push`
- `git-push` not on PATH — install gitbetter: `brew install pointmatic/tap/gitbetter`

**Examples:**
```bash
# Most common: ready to commit the just-completed story to the current branch
project-guide git-push

# Feature-branch push (gitbetter switches to the branch first, offers cleanup after merge)
project-guide git-push feature/heal-command
```

**Optional dependency.** gitbetter is not required for any other `project-guide` command. Install it only if you want this wrapper:
```bash
brew install pointmatic/tap/gitbetter
```

### `override`

Mark a file as customized to prevent automatic updates.

```bash
project-guide override FILE_NAME REASON
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILE_NAME` - Name of the file (positional)
- `REASON` - Why this file is customized (positional)

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide override templates/modes/debug-mode.md "Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools"
```

### `unoverride`

Remove override status from a file.

```bash
project-guide unoverride FILE_NAME
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILE_NAME` - Name of the file (positional)

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide unoverride templates/modes/debug-mode.md
```

### `overrides`

List all overridden files.

```bash
project-guide overrides
```

**Output:**
```
Overridden files:

templates/modes/debug-mode.md
  Reason: Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools
  Since: v2.0.0
  Last updated: 2026-03-03
```

### `purge`

Remove all project-guide files from the current project.

```bash
project-guide purge [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompt
- `--no-input` - Skip confirmation (also auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY stdin)
- `--quiet` / `-q` - Suppress per-file progress output

**Examples:**
```bash
# Purge with confirmation prompt
project-guide purge

# Purge without confirmation
project-guide purge --force

# Unattended purge (CI / non-interactive)
project-guide purge --no-input --force
```

**What gets removed:**
- `.project-guide.yml` configuration file
- Target directory (e.g., `docs/project-guide/`) and all contents

**Warning:** This action cannot be undone. Use with caution.

## Configuration

The `.project-guide.yml` file stores project configuration:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
installed_version: "2.4.12"
target_dir: "docs/project-guide"
metadata_file: ".metadata.yml"
current_mode: "code_direct"
test_first: false
pyve_version: "1.2.3"          # null if pyve not installed

overrides:
  templates/modes/debug-mode.md:
    reason: "Custom debugging workflow for this project"
    locked_version: "2.0.0"
    last_updated: "2026-04-07"

metadata_overrides:             # optional — per-project mode field patches
  plan_stories:
    next_mode: scaffold_project
```

**Fields:**
- `version` - Config file format version
- `installed_version` - Version of files currently installed
- `target_dir` - Where templates are stored
- `metadata_file` - Hidden metadata file inside target dir (default: `.metadata.yml`)
- `current_mode` - Active development mode
- `test_first` - Default coding approach (`false` = `code_direct`, `true` = `code_test_first`)
- `pyve_version` - Detected pyve version at init time; `null` if pyve not installed
- `overrides` - Map of file-level update locks with reason and timestamp
- `metadata_overrides` - Per-project patches for individual mode fields (`next_mode`, `files_exist`, `info`, `description`)

## Available Modes

### Project Planning Modes

One-time-per-project work — the four spec documents that establish the project before any code lands.

| Mode | Command | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Concept** | `project-guide mode plan_concept` | `docs/specs/concept.md` |
| **Features** | `project-guide mode plan_features` | `docs/specs/features.md` |
| **Tech Spec** | `project-guide mode plan_tech_spec` | `docs/specs/tech-spec.md` + `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` (initial population) |
| **Stories** | `project-guide mode plan_stories` | `docs/specs/stories.md` |

### Coding Modes

| Mode | Command | Workflow |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Direct** | `project-guide mode code_direct` | Direct commits, fast iteration |
| **Test-First** | `project-guide mode code_test_first` | TDD red-green-refactor cycle |
| **Debug** | `project-guide mode debug` | Test-driven debugging |

### Documentation Modes

| Mode | Command | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Branding** | `project-guide mode document_brand` | `docs/specs/brand-descriptions.md` |
| **Landing Page** | `project-guide mode document_landing` | GitHub Pages + MkDocs docs |

### Release Planning Modes

Repeated per release — phase planning (pre-1.0 vs. post-1.0), end-of-phase archive.

| Mode | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Phase** | `project-guide mode plan_phase` | Pre-1.0 phase planning. New phase added to `stories.md` + append to `project-essentials.md` |
| **Production Phase** | `project-guide mode plan_production_phase` | Post-1.0 mandatory phase planning. Adds production-readiness checklist + breaking-change negotiation + explicit version-bump target |
| **Archive Stories** | `project-guide mode archive_stories` | Move completed `stories.md` to `.archive/` and re-render an empty one for the next phase |

### Refactoring Modes

| Mode | Command | Workflow |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Plan** | `project-guide mode refactor_plan` | Update `concept`/`features`/`tech-spec` for new capabilities or legacy migration; terminal step refreshes `project-essentials.md` (creates it for legacy projects) |
| **Document** | `project-guide mode refactor_document` | Update README, brand descriptions, landing page, and MkDocs config |

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration file not found"

**Problem:** Running commands outside a project-guide initialized directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
project-guide init
```

### "File already exists"

**Problem:** Trying to initialize when files already exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use --force to overwrite
project-guide init --force

# Or manually remove existing files
rm -rf docs/project-guide .project-guide.yml
project-guide init
```

### "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Insufficient permissions to write files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -la docs/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R u+w docs/
```

### Updates not appearing

**Problem:** Files show as current but you expect updates.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if file is overridden
project-guide overrides

# Force update if needed
project-guide update --force
```
