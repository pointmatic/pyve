# features.md — project-guide (Python)

This document defines **what** the `project-guide` project does — requirements, inputs, outputs, behavior — without specifying **how** it is implemented. This is the source of truth for scope.

For a high-level concept (why), see [`concept.md`](concept.md). For implementation details (how), see [`tech-spec.md`](tech-spec.md). For a breakdown of the implementation plan (step-by-step tasks), see [`stories.md`](stories.md). For project-specific must-know facts that future LLMs need to avoid blunders, see [`project-essentials.md`](project-essentials.md). For the workflow steps tailored to the current mode (cycle steps, approval gates, conventions), see [`docs/project-guide/go.md`](../project-guide/go.md) — re-read it whenever the mode changes or after context compaction.

## Project Goal

`project-guide` is a Python CLI tool that installs a mode-driven template system into software projects, providing structured LLM workflows for planning, coding, debugging, and documentation. Each mode renders a single entry-point document (`go.md`) that the LLM reads to begin collaborating with the developer.

### Core Requirements

1. **Mode-Driven Templates**: Define development workflows as modes, each with its own template, prerequisites, and completion criteria
2. **Dynamic Rendering**: Render a single entry-point document (`go.md`) from Jinja2 templates based on the active mode
3. **Project Initialization**: Install the full template system into any project with a single command
4. **File Synchronization**: Keep installed templates current with the latest package version using content-hash comparison
5. **Override Management**: Allow developers to lock specific files when they contain project-specific customizations
6. **Status Reporting**: Show mode, prerequisites, and file sync state at a glance

### Operational Requirements

1. **CLI Interface**: Intuitive commands for init, mode, status, update, override, purge
2. **Configuration**: Project-specific settings stored in `.project-guide.yml`
3. **Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit consent; backups created on forced updates
4. **Transparency**: Compact status output with grouped sections; verbose mode for details
5. **Idempotency**: Running the same command multiple times produces the same result
6. **Shell Completion**: Tab completion for command names, flags, and mode names (bash, zsh, fish)

### Quality Requirements

1. **Reliability**: Never corrupt or lose project-specific file customizations
2. **Clarity**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance (e.g., "Run `project-guide update` to sync")
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: click, jinja2, pyyaml, packaging — no heavy frameworks
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
5. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% code coverage; parametrized test renders every mode

### Usability Requirements

1. **Primary Users**: Developers using LLM assistance for software projects
2. **Installation**: `pip install project-guide`
3. **Zero Config**: Works with sensible defaults; no configuration required for basic use
4. **Fast Autocomplete**: Short filenames (`go.md`, not `go-project-guide.md`) for IDE/LLM autocomplete

### Non-goals

1. **Not a project scaffolding tool** — manages workflow documentation, not project structure (though `scaffold_project` mode guides the LLM through scaffolding)
2. **Not a code generator** — provides structure for the LLM to follow; code is generated conversationally
3. **Not an LLM API client** — no API calls; the LLM reads rendered markdown documents
4. **Not language-specific** — default templates assume Python but modes are language-agnostic

## Inputs

### Command Line

**`project-guide init`**
- Optional: `--target-dir` (default: `docs/project-guide`)
- Optional: `--force` (overwrite existing files)
- Optional: `--no-input` (skip stdin; auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)

**`project-guide mode [MODE_NAME]`**
- Optional: mode name to switch to
- No argument: list modes grouped by category with ✓/✗/→ markers; interactive numbered menu on TTY
- Optional: `--verbose` / `-v` (show unmet prerequisite file paths)
- Optional: `--no-input` (show listing only, skip interactive menu)

**`project-guide status`**
- Optional: `--verbose` / `-v` (show full per-file list and per-phase story breakdown)

**`project-guide update`**
- Optional: `--files` (specific files to update)
- Optional: `--dry-run` (show what would change without applying)
- Optional: `--force` (update even overridden/modified files, creates backups)
- Optional: `--no-input` (non-interactive; reserved for future prompts)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)

**`project-guide heal`**
- Optional: `--no-input` (auto-yes the `[Y/n]` prompt; emit a one-line stderr notice when writes occur — auto-enabled by `CI=1`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1`, or non-TTY stdin)

**`project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]`**
- Optional positional `BRANCH_NAME` — passed through to gitbetter's `git-push` for branch-aware push flows
- No other flags — the wrapped command is fully interactive (preview, confirm, branch cleanup, reject/recovery menu), so `--no-input` / `--quiet` would be no-ops; for those, route through raw `git-push` instead

**`project-guide override FILE_NAME REASON`**
- Required: file name (template-relative path)
- Required: reason for override

**`project-guide unoverride FILE_NAME`**
- Required: file name

**`project-guide overrides`**
- No arguments

**`project-guide purge`**
- Optional: `--force` (skip confirmation prompt)
- Optional: `--no-input` (skip stdin; auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)

### Configuration File

**`.project-guide.yml`** (created in project root):
```yaml
version: '2.0'
installed_version: 2.0.15
target_dir: docs/project-guide
metadata_file: .metadata.yml
current_mode: default
```

### Metadata File

**`.metadata.yml`** (inside target directory, hidden):
- Defines all modes, their templates, artifacts, prerequisites, and shared variables
- `common` block provides variable substitution across all mode definitions
- Installed by `init`, synced by `update`

---

## Outputs

### File Structure

**After `project-guide init`:**

Only `.project-guide.yml` (config) and `docs/project-guide/go.md` (rendered LLM entry point) are **tracked** in the consumer repo. Everything else under `docs/project-guide/` is gitignored static bundled data — re-populated by `heal` on first invocation in a fresh clone (Phase P, FR-14). The `go.md` file must remain visible to IDE-integrated LLMs (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) which typically hide gitignored files from the LLM's view; that is the constraint that forces `go.md` to stay tracked even though it churns on every mode switch.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Mode-Driven Template Rendering

The system renders a single entry-point document (`go.md`) from Jinja2 templates based on the active mode.

**Behavior:**
1. Entry-point template (`templates/llm_entry_point.md`) includes `_header-common.md` and the active mode's template
2. Mode template includes the appropriate header partial (`_header-sequence.md` or `_header-cycle.md`)
3. Context variables from `.metadata.yml` common block are available in all templates
4. `target_dir` is passed as a Jinja2 context variable
5. Undefined variables render as placeholders (lenient mode), not errors

**Modes (15 total):**

| Mode | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `default` | sequence | Project lifecycle overview for new users |
| `scaffold_project` | sequence | Scaffold LICENSE, headers, manifest, README, CHANGELOG |
| `plan_concept` | sequence | Define problem and solution space |
| `plan_features` | sequence | Define feature requirements |
| `plan_tech_spec` | sequence | Define technical specification |
| `plan_stories` | sequence | Break down into implementation stories |
| `plan_phase` | sequence | Add a new feature phase to an existing project |
| `archive_stories` | sequence | Archive completed stories.md and start fresh for next phase |
| `code_direct` | cycle | Fast coding workflow with commit-per-story |
| `code_test_first` | cycle | Test-driven development workflow |
| `debug` | cycle | Reproduce, isolate, fix, verify workflow |
| `document_brand` | sequence | Define brand descriptions and messaging |
| `document_landing` | sequence | Generate landing page and MkDocs docs |
| `refactor_plan` | cycle | Update planning artifacts for new features or migration |
| `refactor_document` | cycle | Update documentation artifacts for new features or migration |

### FR-2: Project Initialization

`project-guide init` installs the complete template system into a project.

**Behavior:**
1. Copy template tree from package to target directory (default: `docs/project-guide`)
2. Render `go.md` in `default` mode
3. Create `.project-guide.yml` with current version, target directory, metadata file path, and `default` mode
4. Write the canonical `# project-guide` block to `.gitignore` (3 lines: ignore everything under `target_dir` except `go.md` — the LLM reads it and IDE-integrated LLMs hide gitignored files from the LLM's view; see FR-14)
5. Report number of files installed

**Edge Cases:**
- `.project-guide.yml` exists → error unless `--force`
- Files already exist → skip without `--force`, overwrite with `--force`

### FR-3: File Synchronization (Hash-Based)

`project-guide update` syncs installed files to the latest package templates using content-hash comparison.

**Behavior:**
1. For each tracked file, compare SHA-256 hash of installed file vs bundled template
2. Hash matches → current (no action)
3. Hash differs and not overridden → prompt user to backup and overwrite
4. File missing → create it
5. File overridden → skip (unless `--force`)
6. After updating template files, re-render `go.md` for the current mode
7. Update `installed_version` in config

**Key design decision:** Version numbers do not determine freshness. A package version bump that doesn't change a specific template will not flag that file as needing an update.

**Edge Cases:**
- `--dry-run` → show changes without applying
- `--force` → backup and overwrite modified/overridden files without prompting
- `--files` → sync only specific files

### FR-4: Override Management

`project-guide override` locks a file from updates.

**Behavior:**
1. Verify file exists in tracked file list
2. Record override in `.project-guide.yml` with reason, locked version, and date
3. `update` skips overridden files unless `--force`

`project-guide unoverride` removes the lock.

`project-guide overrides` lists all overridden files with reasons.

### FR-5: Status Reporting

`project-guide status` shows a compact, grouped summary.

**Sections:**
1. **Header**: package version; installed version shown only when it differs
2. **Mode**: current mode name and description; prerequisites when applicable; hint to list modes
3. **Guide**: rendered entry-point path; onboarding hint
4. **Files**: summary counts (current, need updating, missing, overridden); `--verbose` for per-file list; hint to update when needed
5. **Stories** (when `stories.md` exists and contains stories): total/done/in-progress/planned counts; next unstarted story; `--verbose` adds per-phase breakdown

**Styling:** Bold labels, cyan highlights for mode name and guide path, color-coded file counts (green/yellow/red), dim action prompts.

### FR-6: Purge

`project-guide purge` removes all project-guide files.

**Behavior:**
1. Show what will be removed (config file and target directory)
2. Confirm unless `--force`
3. Remove target directory and config file

### FR-8: Non-Interactive / CI Mode

`--no-input`, `CI=1`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1`, and non-TTY stdin all suppress interactive prompts on `init`, `update`, `purge`, and `heal`. The first matching trigger wins (priority order: explicit flag → env var → CI env → non-TTY).

**Behavior:**
- `purge`: skips the "Are you sure?" confirmation prompt when any trigger fires. Combines with `--force` (the latter signals intent; the former signals environment).
- `update`: flag is present for future-prompt parity; `update` currently has no interactive prompts.
- `init`: flag is present; no prompts exist today but the plumbing is in place.
- `heal`: replaces the `[Y/n]` drift prompt with auto-yes; emits a one-line stderr notice (`Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.`) so CI logs and embedding callers have a visible signal. The auto-hook (FR-14) inherits the same contract via env / TTY signals.

### FR-9: Quiet Mode (machine / embedding)

`--quiet` / `-q` on `init`, `update`, and `purge` is intended for **embedded** and CI callers that compose with **`--no-input`** (e.g. pyve scaffolding refreshes).

**Behavior:**
- On **success**, these commands emit **nothing to stdout** (including dry-run summaries, progress banners, and green completion lines).
- **Errors** and **material warnings** are **never suppressed**: they print to **stderr** (e.g. schema/load failures, render warnings, skipped overridden files, `init --force` previous-config backup notice, purge “not found (skipped)” hints when paths were already removed).
- Exit codes are unchanged vs non-quiet invocation.

**Interaction with `--verbose`:** Only **`project-guide mode`** defines `--verbose` today; there is no combined `--quiet` + `--verbose` on the same command. If both flags ever apply to one command, **`--quiet` wins**.

### FR-10: Story Detection in Status

`project-guide status` parses `<spec_artifacts_path>/stories.md` and adds a **Stories** section showing total/done/in-progress/planned counts and the next unstarted story. Section is omitted when the file is absent or contains no story headings (e.g., post-archive). `--verbose` adds a per-phase breakdown.

### FR-11: Mode Listing with Availability Markers and Interactive Menu

`project-guide mode` (no argument) displays a grouped, annotated mode listing:

- Modes are grouped by category (Getting Started, Project Planning, Scaffold, Coding, Debugging, Documentation, Refactoring, Release Planning) with ordered category headers reflecting the project lifecycle flow.
- Each mode is annotated: `→` (current, cyan background highlight), `✓` (all prerequisites met, green), `✗` (unmet prerequisites, yellow, dimmed name).
- `--verbose` / `-v` shows the unmet prerequisite file paths beneath each `✗` entry.
- On a real TTY (unless `--no-input`, `CI=1`, or non-TTY stdin), a numbered selection menu is shown after the listing, allowing the developer to switch mode by entering a number. Empty input cancels. Up to 3 attempts before exit 1.

### FR-12: Per-Project Metadata Overrides

`metadata_overrides` in `.project-guide.yml` allows per-project patching of individual mode fields without editing the bundled `.metadata.yml`. Only these fields are patchable: `next_mode`, `files_exist`, `info`, `description`. Partial patch semantics — unmentioned fields are unchanged. Unknown mode names or fields raise `MetadataError`. Overrides are applied at every `load_metadata()` call site.

### FR-13: Pyve Detection and Auto-Rendered pyve-essentials.md

`project-guide init` detects whether `pyve` is installed by running `pyve --version`. On success, the version string is stored as `pyve_version` in `.project-guide.yml`; on failure (`FileNotFoundError`, non-zero exit, timeout), `null` is stored. Detection failure is non-fatal.

The `pyve_installed` boolean (derived from `pyve_version`) is passed as a Jinja2 context variable at every render call site. When true, `render.py` reads `templates/artifacts/pyve-essentials.md` from the template tree and passes its content as the `pyve_essentials` context variable. `_header-common.md` renders it as a `### Pyve Essentials` subsection nested inside the `## Project Essentials` wrapper, so every `go.md` across every mode surfaces the bundled pyve rules automatically.

This is a package-versioned auto-render rather than a one-shot merge: improvements to `pyve-essentials.md` flow to every project on the next `project-guide mode <name>` invocation without any scaffold-time copy step.

The bundled `templates/artifacts/pyve-essentials.md` artifact covers: two-environment pattern, canonical invocation forms, LLM-internal vs. developer-facing invocation rule, `python` vs `python3` asdf-shim rule, `requirements-dev.txt` story-writing convention, and editable install / testenv dependency management.

### FR-14: Auto-Heal & Self-Repair Install

`project-guide heal` repairs the install in place: detects drift between the bundled package templates and the on-disk template tree under `target_dir`, then creates missing files and refreshes stale (hash-divergent) ones. Unlike `update`, `heal` also creates missing files — so it is the right command after a fresh clone in a repo that gitignores everything under `target_dir` except `go.md`.

**Inputs:** `--no-input` (auto-yes the prompt; emit stderr notice — see FR-8).

**Behavior:**
- **Silent when clean.** Zero drift → exit 0 with no stdout. This silence is required so the auto-hook below can fire on every invocation without polluting steady-state output.
- **Prompts when drift is detected.** Interactive: print one-line stderr summary (`N templates missing or stale.`), then `Update? [Y/n]` (default Y on bare Enter). Decline → exit 1 without writing.
- **Auto-yes under skip-input mode** (FR-8): replace the prompt with the stderr notice `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` then apply.
- **Hard error on missing config.** Missing `.project-guide.yml` → exit 1 with `Missing .project-guide.yml — run 'project-guide init' to bootstrap the project.` `heal` does not bootstrap.
- **Schema mismatch handling** mirrors `update`: older-schema → point at `init --force`; newer-schema → instruct to upgrade the package.

**Auto-hook (recursion-guarded):** every `project-guide` invocation, **including `--help` and `--version`**, runs the heal drift-detection + prompt path *before* dispatching the subcommand. The hook is implemented as a custom Click `Group` subclass that overrides `main()` so eager flags (`--help`, `--version`) do not short-circuit before the hook runs. The hook is silent in the steady state and prompts only on actual drift; declining the prompt does not block the original subcommand. Recursion across nested `project-guide` subprocess invocations is prevented by setting `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1` in `os.environ` whenever `heal` runs (whether via the hook or invoked directly).

**Skip conditions for the hook:**
- `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1` is set (recursion guard).
- `.project-guide.yml` is absent (let `init` bootstrap; the hook does not error).
- The config fails to load (schema mismatch, parse error) — the subcommand surfaces the error with its own guidance.

**Inverted gitignore policy.** `init`'s gitignore writer produces a canonical block under a `# project-guide` header that ignores everything under `target_dir` *except* `go.md`. The block has gone through three shapes; the **tracking status** of `go.md` flipped in v2.8.0 (P.d → P.j → P.l → P.o):

- **v2.6.0 (P.d):** 4-line negation form (`<target>/**` + `!<target>/go.md` + redundant `<target>/**/*.bak.*`).
- **v2.6.1 (P.j):** 3-line negation form — dropped the redundant `.bak.*` line.
- **v2.7.1 (P.l):** **negation-free explicit-list form** — lists every top-level entry under `target_dir` other than `go.md`, plus a `<target>/**/*.bak.*` catch-all for top-level backups. The list is generated dynamically from the bundled template tree, so new top-level files/subdirectories added in future releases are picked up automatically.
- **v2.8.0 (P.o):** **untracked-by-default `go.md`**. The gitignore block is unchanged from v2.7.1 — `go.md` is still un-listed (and therefore unignored), preserving IDE-LLM visibility. What flips is the **tracking status**: `go.md` is no longer in the consumer's git index. `heal` warns (stderr) when it detects a tracked `go.md` with a copyable `git rm --cached docs/project-guide/go.md && git commit` migration command; `init` emits a stderr note that fresh installs leave `go.md` untracked. Branch switches and merges no longer trip on `go.md`.

P.l abandoned the negation form because several IDE-integrated tools (Cursor, parts of the VS Code fork ecosystem, certain LSP-based search backends) implement a subset of `.gitignore` semantics that does not honor re-include negation — they apply the broad `**` rule, hide `go.md` from @-mention / fuzzy-search, and defeat the IDE-LLM-visibility constraint that's the whole reason `go.md` stays unignored. The v2.8.0 tracking flip preserves that visibility — `go.md` remains unignored — while removing the version-control churn and branch-switch failure mode that motivated P.o.

Consumers migrating from a pre-Phase-P install run `project-guide init --force` to refresh the gitignore block. Consumers upgrading from v2.6.x/v2.7.x to v2.8.0 run `git rm --cached docs/project-guide/go.md && git commit` once on their default branch to migrate the tracking status; `heal` surfaces the warning until the migration is applied. Existing pre-v2.7.1 installs heal to the v2.7.1 explicit-list form on the next `init --force` — every prior shape stays recognized by `_is_recognized_block_line()`.

### FR-15: Story-Aware `git-push` Wrapper (gitbetter integration)

`project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]` wraps [gitbetter](https://github.com/pointmatic/gitbetter)'s `git-push` with story metadata: it derives the commit message from the most-recently-completed-and-not-yet-committed story in `docs/specs/stories.md` and shells out to gitbetter to perform the actual push. The wrapper collapses the developer's per-story commit step from "find the story ID, format the message, type the command" to a single command, while delegating every real git operation (preview, confirm, branch cleanup, reject/recovery menu) to gitbetter.

**Heading-to-message transformation:**
- Input: `### Story G.a: v1.2.3 New command \`foo\` with "Hello" [Done]`
- Output: `G.a: v1.2.3 New command 'foo' with 'Hello'`
- Rules: strip `### Story ` prefix and ` [Done]` suffix; replace backticks and double quotes with single quotes; preserve single quotes and the colon after the story ID. The colon is the anchor the already-committed check searches for in `git log --pretty=%s`.

**Hard errors (exit 1):**
- `docs/specs/stories.md` is absent.
- No `[Done]` story in `stories.md`.
- The last `[Done]` story is already committed (per `git log` subject prefix match) — the wrapper does not second-guess; the developer resolves manually with raw `git-push`.
- Multiple `[Done]` stories are uncommitted — same reasoning. The wrapper is for the common "one story done, ready to push" case; multi-story batches are explicit-is-better-than-implicit.
- `git-push` is not on PATH — the wrapper prints the install hint (`brew install pointmatic/tap/gitbetter`) and exits.

**Child-process semantics.** The wrapper invokes `git-push` via `subprocess.run(argv, check=False)` with no captured output, so gitbetter inherits the parent's stdin/stdout/stderr and stays fully interactive. The child's exit code is propagated to `sys.exit` unchanged so gitbetter's reject/recovery menu surfaces with real semantics.

**LLM-vs-developer-lane.** This is a developer-lane convenience command. The LLM **does not** initiate it — the approval-gate discipline (do not propose commits, pushes, or follow-ups at story-end) remains in force. The wrapper is invoked by the developer after the LLM presents a completed story.

**`spec_artifacts_path` resolution.** The wrapper reads `spec_artifacts_path` from project-guide metadata when available; otherwise falls back to `docs/specs`. This lets the wrapper work in projects that haven't yet run `project-guide init`, including this project itself before metadata renders.

### FR-7: Shell Completion

Tab completion for `project-guide` commands, flags, and mode names in bash, zsh, and fish.

**Behavior:**
1. **Static completion** (commands and flags) is provided automatically by Click for any user who enables shell completion via the standard `_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=<shell>_source` environment variable
2. **Dynamic mode name completion**: `project-guide mode <TAB>` reads the active project's `.metadata.yml` and returns matching mode names; works with custom modes
3. Completion callbacks never crash the user's shell — any error returns an empty list silently

**Setup:**
- bash: `eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=bash_source project-guide)"` in `~/.bashrc`
- zsh: `eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=zsh_source project-guide)"` in `~/.zshrc`
- fish: `_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=fish_source project-guide | source` in `~/.config/fish/completions/project-guide.fish`

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Metadata loading, variable resolution, mode lookup
- Jinja2 rendering with mode templates and header partials
- Config save/load round-trip, override management
- File sync: hash comparison, copy, backup
- Template path resolution and file discovery

### Integration Tests
- Full init → override → update workflow
- Hash-based status (version mismatch with matching content shows "current")
- Force update with backups
- Multi-project isolation
- Dry-run mode

### Parametrized Tests
- Every mode in `.metadata.yml` must render without errors (regression guard for new modes)

**Minimum Coverage**: 85% code coverage (currently ~91%)

## Security and Compliance Notes

1. **File Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit consent (`--force` or user approval)
2. **Backup Creation**: `.bak` backups with timestamps created before any forced overwrite
3. **No Secrets**: Package contains only documentation templates, no sensitive data
4. **No Network**: Operates entirely offline after installation

---

## Performance Expectations

1. **File I/O**: All operations are file-based; performance is not a concern
2. **Hash Comparison**: SHA-256 hash of small files (<100KB each) is effectively instant
3. **Rendering**: Jinja2 template rendering completes in milliseconds

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `project-guide init` creates the full template tree and renders `go.md` in `default` mode; detects pyve and stores `pyve_version`
2. `project-guide mode <name>` switches mode and re-renders `go.md`
3. `project-guide mode` (no argument) shows grouped listing with ✓/✗/→ markers; interactive menu on TTY
4. `project-guide status` shows compact grouped output with hash-based file state and Stories section
5. `project-guide update` syncs files using content-hash comparison, not version numbers
6. `project-guide override/unoverride` manages file locks correctly
7. `project-guide purge` cleanly removes all project-guide files; respects `--no-input` / `CI=1`
8. `--no-input` and `--quiet` on `init`, `update`, `purge`, and `heal`: prompts suppressed via FR-8; FR-9 guarantees **silent stdout on success** and diagnostics on stderr; under skip-input `heal` emits the `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` stderr notice when writes occur
9. `metadata_overrides` in `.project-guide.yml` patches mode fields without editing bundled metadata
10. All 15 modes render without errors (parametrized test)
11. Shell completion (Tab) works for commands, flags, and mode names in bash/zsh/fish after one-line setup
12. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
13. Test coverage is ≥85%
14. Package is published to PyPI as `project-guide`
15. `project-guide heal` (FR-14) is **silent on no drift** and applies fixes after the `[Y/n]` prompt on drift; under `--no-input` / `CI=1` / non-TTY the prompt is replaced with auto-yes plus the `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` stderr notice
16. The auto-hook fires for every CLI invocation including `--help` and `--version`, is silent in the steady state, recursion-guarded by `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1`, and never blocks the original subcommand on prompt decline
17. `project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]` (FR-15) derives the commit message from the last `[Done]` story, hard-errors on already-committed or multi-uncommitted-Done states or missing gitbetter, and propagates gitbetter's child exit code unchanged
